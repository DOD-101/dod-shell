# dod-shell

> My personal shell designed to be integrated with my [NixOs](https://github.com/dod-101/nixOS-dots) config

## ❗ Note ❗

This is designed primarily for my personal use.
Because of this don't expect this to be super-duper configurable or act like a sort of widget framework. 
If you are looking for something like that I recommend looking at something like 
[ags](https://github.com/Aylur/ags) or [eww](https://github.com/elkowar/eww/pull/1289).

Nonetheless if you are looking to write your own shell / widgets from scratch using rust this repo will be a valuable resource on how to do just that.
